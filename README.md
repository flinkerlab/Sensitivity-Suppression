# Sensitivity-Suppression

DAF data files consist of high gamma activity (70-150Hz) recorded with ecog during the production of words with 0, 50, 100, and 200 ms auditory feedback delay.

Data files are organized as trials x channels x time
Time: -1.5:0.01:3.5 seconds, trials were epoched  with respect to the onset of speech production

Anatomical locations of the channels in the data files can be found in the anat.mat file

MATLAB Psychtoolbox-3 scripts that were used to present the DAF stimuli can be found under Experiments Script folder
